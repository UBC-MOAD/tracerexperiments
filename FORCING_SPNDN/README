This experiment has a body forcing that does what I originally though the other one was doing: 
Ramp up during 1st day, constant next day and then off.

In external_forcing.F I modified Jessica's to cut the forcing after a time ST+FT (sr = 0  and delete last ELSEIF):


C---Forcing Time, time Umax is applied
      FT=86400*1
      
C---Short Time, ramp up time before starting a constant forcing
      ST=86400*1

C---Max. Velocity U-dir at Coast (m/s)
      Umax= 0.315
C-- Final, steady forcing ratio
      sr = 0.0
C---Max. Forcing at Coast (accel.)
      gUmax=Umax/(FT + ST/2.)
C---Slope of forcing
      alpha=gUmax/ST
       DO j=jMin,jMax
        DO i=iMin,iMax
           IF (myTime.LE.ST) THEN
             bf(i,j)=alpha*myTime  
     &   *(yC(i, j, bi, bj) /(90000-35000))
     &   *_hFacW(i,j,kLev,bi,bj)
             ELSE IF (myTime.LE.FT+ST) THEN
                bf(i,j)= alpha*ST*(yC(i, j, bi, bj)/(90000-35000))
     &   *_hFacW(i,j,kLev,bi,bj)   
                         ELSE
                            bf(i,j)=sr*alpha*ST
     &   *(yC(i, j, bi, bj) /(90000-35000))
     &   *_hFacW(i,j,kLev,bi,bj)
             ENDIF
        ENDDO
       ENDDO
C---Changed maskW(i,j,klev,bi,bj) for hFacW(i,j,klev,bi,bj) in the do(do)) loop KRM 31-oct-14      
       DO j=jMin,jMax
        DO i=iMin,iMax
           gU(i,j,kLev,bi,bj) = gU(i,j,kLev,bi,bj)+bf(i,j)
ENDDO
ENDDO
